# Cell Counting Made Easy: Leveraging Computer Vision for Microscopy Image Analysis 

We propose the use of object detection as an approach to count cells present in a microscopy image. To evaluate its accuracy, we used a dataset of images from the IDCIA v1 set for annotation and training and then images from the IDCIA v2 set for further testing.
