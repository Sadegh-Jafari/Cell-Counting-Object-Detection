# Cell Counting Made Easy: Leveraging Computer Vision for Microscopy Image Analysis 

We propose the use of object detection as an approach to count cells present in a microscopy image. To evaluate its accuracy, we used a dataset of images from the IDCIA v1 set for annotation and training and then images from the IDCIA v2 set for further testing.


**Code Contribution:**

- **Sadegh:** Contributed to the following files: `Ablation Study.ipynb`, `ACP5per.py`, `ADC Ablation Study.ipynb`, `ADC & Visualization.ipynb`, `filters.ipynb`, `MAE.py`, and `Training.ipynb`. Sadegh also completed part of the data annotation.

- **Nazifa:** Developed the `data visualization.ipynb` code and was one of the main annotators.

- **Rayan:** Served as the primary data annotator.ain annotators.
